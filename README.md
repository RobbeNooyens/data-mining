# Data Mining

## Project Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections:

1. **Classification** - Predicting income levels using various machine learning models while ensuring fairness and high predictive accuracy.
2. **Clustering** - Exploring clustering techniques on a dataset of 2500 news articles categorize the articles based on their content.
3. **Pattern Mining** - Analyzing patterns in a dataset concerning income levels to uncover socio-economic characteristics influencing male and female working conditions.

Each section includes a detailed report as a PDF, source code in Python, and datasets used for the analyses.

## Reports

### 1. Classification

- **Objective**: Evaluate and compare different machine learning models in terms of accuracy and fairness.
- **Key Models Used**: Decision trees, KNN, random forest, and ensemble methods.
- **Main Findings**: Identification of the best model that balances fairness with predictive accuracy.

### 2. Clustering

- **Objective**: Apply clustering methods to categorize news articles into distinct groups.
- **Techniques Used**: KMeans, DBSCAN, and various dimensionality reduction methods.
- **Main Findings**: Effective categorization of articles into coherent groups that reflect their content.

### 3. Pattern Mining

- **Objective**: Identify patterns that distinguish between different socio-economic groups.
- **Approach**: Data preprocessing and analysis using pattern mining techniques.
- **Main Findings**: Insights into the socio-economic characteristics that differentiate male and female working conditions.
